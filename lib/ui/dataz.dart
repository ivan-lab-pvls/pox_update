    'Global Supply Chain Challenges Affect Manufacturing Sector',
    'The manufacturing sector is grappling with global supply chain challenges that have resulted in price hikes for raw materials and components. Shortages of semiconductors, shipping disruptions, and labor shortages have impacted production, leading to increased costs and potential delays in delivering goods to consumers, which could have implications for inflation and economic recovery. Supply chain is the backbone of the manufacturing industry. Itâ€™s the process of securing the parts, goods and raw materials necessary to complete the production of specific goods and products. Supply chain in manufacturing is extremely complex. It includes networking with various suppliers and managing the shipping and delivery processes. A supply chain shortage is caused by one or more disruptions in these processes. Disruptions are not a new challenge for manufacturers. What is new, however, is the number of disruptions impacting multiple points in the supply chain process simultaneously. These disruptions, in turn, caused a ripple effect that eventually impacted nearly every manufacturing plant in the world.',

    'The Federal Reserve has sent signals indicating a possible interest rate hike as part of its efforts to tackle rising inflation. With the economy rebounding and inflationary pressures mounting, the central bank aims to ensure price stability by potentially tightening monetary policy, which could have implications for borrowing costs and investment strategies. The (Federal Open Market) Committee will continue to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy," the Fed said in language that was little changed from its June 14 statement and which left the central bank\'s policy options open as it searches for a stopping point to the current tightening cycle. Powell made no promises either way, with a September meeting eight weeks from now considered "live" for another rate increase, though a continued slowing of inflation and weaker economic data may also prompt policymakers to pause.',
